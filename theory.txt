The Web is split into two parts 
-> Frontend 
-> Backend
Frontend is all about user experience with three key parts
. User (me,you and anyone interacting with the app whether scrolling through instagram reading a blog or watching one yt vidoes one after other )
. Client which is a device or an app like your browswer that connects us to the web.
. Interface , the layout and the design we interact with built with nextjs react or html css js . 
  
Information comes from servers
Servers is just a powerful computer designed to store process and send data it's a real machine
sitting in a data center somewhere that you can own or rent through services like AWS
On the server we store the backend code the logic that handles everything from processing data to 
managing users and interacting with databases so how does your device the clinet communicate
